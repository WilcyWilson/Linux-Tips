## What is a Shell?

- The shell is a default user interface to a linux system.

- When you login to a linux server like in Putty on Windows over the network the shell is the program that is started and acts as your default interface to the system.

- Also if you are prompted with a text based login prompt during booting the linux system, you will also be interacting with a shell by default.

- If you login to a GUI system. Then you need to start the Terminal Emulator application to gain access to the shell.

- The GUI interface on a linux system is also called a shell. Its a graphical shell.
But when someone refers to shell they are generally refering to the CUI interface.

- It is simply a program that accepts your commands and executes those commands.

- Its also called command line interpreter.

## Command Line Interface Vs a GUI?

- For eg: If you have several files and you need to perform same operation on those files. You can often do this easily on the shell.
So, you have 100 documents to rename then from the shell you can rename 100 documents at once.

- If you are using a graphical user interface you have to click on each file and rename them and do that 100 times.

- Another reason to use CUI is most server distributions of Linux system do not include a GUI.

- Also if you are connecting through ssh to a linux server you need to use a CUI.

- Desktop Distributions have both GUI and CLI which is best of both worlds. Each has its own advantage.

- There are even command line web browsers on linux.

## What is a Shell Prompt? What information does it give?
A shell prompt is something that is displayed when the shell is started.

- The prompt just sits there and waits for you to type the command.
- The shell prompt gives you useful information like username@name of linux system you are connected to.
- jason is the username and linuxsvr is the name of linux system you are connected to.
- At the end of the prompt you see a $ sign. This is the indication that you are using the system as a normal user as opposed to a super user.
